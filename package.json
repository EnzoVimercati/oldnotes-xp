  "description": "OldNotes XP is a nostalgic, visually driven note-taking app inspired by the iconic Windows XP interface. Designed to evoke familiarity and simplicity, the project brings back the charm of classic computing while integrating modern features for intuitive note organization. With a clean, modular layout reminiscent of XP's windowed structure, users can effortlessly create, sort, and manage notes just like navigating old-school folders and files. The interface includes pixel-style accents, classic color schemes, and playful design cues that blend retro aesthetics with practical functionality, making it both fun and efficient to use."
